# Bots on Twitter

A collection of bots I've made.

[Millennial Massacre](https://twitter.com/MillennialKills) - an absurd bot that loops through a massive list of nouns and declares each dead at the hands of millennials. Place and method of death are specified with appropriate absurdity. 

[Biodiversity Bot](https://twitter.com/BiodiversityBot) - a bot that tweets images from the archives of Biodiversity Heritage Library, as made available on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=bookcollectionbiodiversity)

[LocMap](https://twitter.com/LoCMapBot) - a bot that tweets images of maps from the Library of Congress' digital collections, through [its API](https://labs.loc.gov/lc-for-robots/)
